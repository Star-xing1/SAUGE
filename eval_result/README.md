# Pre-computed Results and Evaluation
We have organized the precomputed results for BSDS500 datasets under various settings in the `eval_result` directory. To reproduce the results reported in the paper, modify the relevant paths and configurations in `eval_result/best_ods_ois.py` and then run `python best_ods_ois.py`.
